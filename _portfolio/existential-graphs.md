## Overview

**Link:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Conair94/Triangle-free-finite-random-graphs)

This project involves the computational search for graphs with specific combinatorial properties.

### contributions
*   **Algorithm Design:** Implemented a graph generation and exhaustive search algorithm in **C** to catalog low-vertex examples for graphs with certain combinatorial properties.
*   **Cloud Implementation:** Deployed the algorithm on **Google Cloud Platform**.
*   **Data Management:** Created a searchable database of results in **BigQuery**.
