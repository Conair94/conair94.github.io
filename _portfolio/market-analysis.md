## Overview

*Note: This is a placeholder for a future project. Edit this file `_portfolio/market-analysis.md` to describe your actual GitHub project.*

In this project, I applied **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to predict short-term price movements of S&P 500 stocks. The goal was to outperform standard time-series models like ARIMA by capturing non-linear dependencies in the data.

### Key Technologies
*   Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
*   TensorFlow / Keras
*   Financial APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)

### Results
*   Achieved a predictive accuracy of X%.
*   Backtested strategy showed a Sharpe Ratio of Y.
