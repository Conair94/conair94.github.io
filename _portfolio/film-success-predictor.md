## Overview

**Link:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Conair94/fall-2025-predicting-movie-success-connor-fork)

Using the Letterboxd review dataset, I implemented accuracy analysis metrics inspired by pollster ratings and outlier detection to identify reviewers with predictive power for critical success of films. 

### Key Methodologies
*   **Community Detection:** Formed aggregates of reviewers via community detection algorithms.
*   **Machine Learning & Time-Series:** Used ML models alongside time-series analysis to understand reviewer sentiment trends.
*   **Alpha Generation:** Generated predictive signals for award outcomes, analogous to alpha generation, with planned applications including finding mispricing on financial betting markets.

### Organization
*   **The Erdős Institute**
