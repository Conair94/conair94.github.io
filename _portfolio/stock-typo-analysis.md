Designed a data analysis pipeline to study the prevalence of buying pressure due to typos made by retail traders.

### Key Features
*   **Automated Pipeline:** Automated pulling of latest trade data and analysis of likely ticker pairs.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Used smart filtering of names and keyboard distance (Levenshtein distance) to identify alpha based on genuine typos as opposed to spurious correlations.
*   **Event Detection:** Implemented analysis to detect typo trading on high-volume and high-likelihood days, such as IPOs.
