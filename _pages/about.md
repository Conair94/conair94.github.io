I am a 5th year Mathematics PhD candidate at the [University of Maryland](https://www-math.umd.edu/), specializing in **Model Theory** with applications in probability, geometry, and combinatorics. 

My research requires a deep understanding of abstract structures and rigorous logical reasoning, skills I am eager to apply to complex problems in the financial sector. I am currently seeking opportunities as a **Quantitative Researcher**, where I can leverage my mathematical expertise and programming skills to develop and analyze sophisticated financial models.

### Interests
*   **Quantitative Finance:** Stochastic calculus, derivatives pricing, algorithmic trading strategies.
*   **Machine Learning:** Deep learning, reinforcement learning, time-series analysis.
*   **Mathematics:** Model theory, probability theory, combinatorics.

Please feel free to explore my [Projects](/portfolio/) and [Publications](/publications/) to learn more about my work. You can also view my [CV](/cv/).
