I am a 5th year Mathematics PhD candidate at the [University of Maryland](https://www-math.umd.edu/), specializing in **Model Theory** with applications in probability, geometry, and combinatorics. I also work in formal methods and am a passionate data scientist. 

My research requires a deep understanding of abstract structures and rigorous logical reasoning, skills I am eager to apply to complex problems in the financial sector. I am currently seeking opportunities as a **Quantitative Researcher**, where I can leverage my mathematical expertise and programming skills to develop and analyze sophisticated financial models.

Please feel free to explore my [Projects](/portfolio/) page <!--- and [Publications](/publications/) ---> to learn more about my work. You can also view my [CV](/cv/).
